Alzheimer Disease Prediction 

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is Serious mental illness affecting the brain. the
reason for dementia in the elderly people. Around 45 million people are suffering from
this disease. Alzheimer’s disease spreads rapidly over the years. This disease has a
significant impact on the social, financial, and economic aspects. Early treatment of
Alzheimer's disease is more effective and causes less brain damage. Since Alzheimer's is
a chronic disease, we should have taken care of early detection using machine learning.
This proposed model represents the analysis and the result regarding detecting
Dementia from various machine learning models. longitudinal Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) data from OASIS has been used for the development of the system.
Several techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine,
Logistic Regression and keras neural network have been employed to identify the best
parameters for Alzheimer’s disease prediction. we obtained 0.97, 0.1, 0.944 and 0.971
for the Accuracy, precision, Recall, F1_score respectively.
